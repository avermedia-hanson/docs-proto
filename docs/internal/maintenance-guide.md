## Change the icons

The current icons are downloaded from our official website. The favicon is stored as `assets/images/favicon.png`, and the logo is stored as `assets/images/logo.png`. One can either replace the existing files, or change the `logo` and `favicon` settings in the `theme` section of the `mkdocs.yml` file.
