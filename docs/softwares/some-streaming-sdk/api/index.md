# API Reference

> Here we show how to integrate different versions of the API reference generated by Doxygen.

The API references are available for the following versions:

- 1.3 ([online](v1.3/index.html) | offline)
- 1.2 ([online](v1.2/index.html) | offline)

!!! warning

    The version control for this SDK is actually problematic, because the getting started page and the examples are not versioned.

!!! note "Versioning of the API reference"

    The patch version number and the smaller version numbers should not be included in the API reference, because a patch should not change the API. For example, the API of version 1.3.1 should be the same as the API of version 1.3.0.
