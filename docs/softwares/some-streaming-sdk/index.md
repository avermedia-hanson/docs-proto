# Some Streaming SDK

The main documentation, including the guides, examples, and tutorials, is handled by the main `mkdocs` project, and the API references for different versions are generated by Doxygen.

The pros and cons of this approach are listed below.

### Pros

- The sections will have the same look and feel as the site.
- The sections can be nicely integrated to the left navigation sidebar.

### Cons

- All the sections except the API reference contents are **NOT versioned** :rotating_light:.

## Sections

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   Getting Started

    ---

    Almost all the software projects provide a getting started guide, so we have one too.
    `mkdocs-material` features like tabs and note/tips boxes are demonstrated here.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Getting Started](getting-started.md)

-   Examples

    ---

    The two use cases in the example section show how the code blocks look in `mkdocs-material`.
    Features like line numbers and copy button are enabled.

-   API Reference

    ---

    Several versions of the API reference (generated by Doxygen) are available for this SDK.
