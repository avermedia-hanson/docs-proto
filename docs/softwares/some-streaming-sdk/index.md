# Some Streaming SDK

The actual contents (different versions of the API reference) are generated by Doxygen, and all the other sections, including the home page of the API reference, are handled by the main `mkdocs` project (the site).

### Pros

- The sections will have the same look and feel as the site.
- The sections can be nicely integrated to the left navigation sidebar.

### Cons

- All the sections except the API reference contents are **NOT versioned**.

-   Getting Started

    ---

    Almost all the software projects provide a getting started guide, so we have one too.
    `mkdocs-material` features like tabs and note/tips boxes are demonstrated here.

-   Examples

    ---

    The two use cases in the example section show how the code blocks look in `mkdocs-material`.
    Features like line numbers and copy button are enabled.
