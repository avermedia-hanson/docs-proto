# Softwares

As the home page of the software tab, our software products may be showcased here.

But this is just a prototype, so we are going to demonstrate different ways to handle software documentation, with a bunch of dummy software projects. Here is an overview of these projects:

Here is a brief summary table of the dummy software projects in the demo:

| Language | Dummy Project Name | Brief Description |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| C++      | Some Streaming SDK | <ul><li>Main docs handled by this `mkdocs` project (this site)</li><li>API reference generated by Doxygen</li></ul> |
| C++      | Some Audio SDK     | <ul><li>Almost all the docs generated by Doxygen</li><li>Only entry page handled by this `mkdocs` project (this site)</li></ul> |
| C++      | Some Video SDK     | <ul><li>Main docs handled by another `mkdocs` project</li><li>API reference generated by Doxygen</li></ul> |
| Python   | Some AI SDK        | Work in progress |

Each method has its own pros and cons. It is recommended to take a look at these dummy projects to check the user experience. The pros and cons are listed in the main page of each project. Some of the features of the documentation tools (`mkdocs-material` and `Doxygen`) also are demonstrated in pages like "Getting Started".
